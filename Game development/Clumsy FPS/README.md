# Game project for school

Here is a small FPS-project made with Unity I made for school. I use the same level design shown in different folder and enhanced it visualli with fog effects and particle effects. All the assets are premade CC0 assets. 

The enemies (glowing red blobs) spaw on random locations and if the player moves too close, they attack. If they touch the player, the game is over.

**The goal:** Get to the cabin on the other side of the map alive. You have a gun as your protection. You get points from killing enemies but every enemy killed two new enemies spawn.

The project made is kinda clumsy but I'm kinda proud of it because it is my first project that can be called a game.
