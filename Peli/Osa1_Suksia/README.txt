# Gamifying assignment for school project

The given screenshots and scripts are from a gamifying assignment for school. The idea was to gamify an apartment for virtual aparment presentation. The project was made with Unity game engine.

Project has automatic doors with colliders, lighting effects, Post-Processing and fire made with Unity Particle System

The assets used are from 3DWarehouse and Unity Standard assets pack. The design and development, both indoors and outdoors, is done by me.
